driving_test,how to get driving licence?,,,utter_driving_test,To get a South Carolina license, students will need to prove proficiency in their driving ability through a written test of the South Carolina traffic laws followed by a road skills test. To study for the written test, a copy of the South Carolina Driver's Manual may be downloaded (see helpful links). After passing the written test, a road test (or driving test) is required at the SCDMV located at 1630 Shop Road. Students must provide their own car or a friend's car in order to take the test. The driving test may be taken more than once if necessary.
